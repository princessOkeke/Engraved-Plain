# Engraved Plain

## Overview
**Engraved Plain** is a strategic twist on tic-tac-toe, played on a 5x5 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces with X or O, but each player has three restricted spaces they cannot use. The objective is to align four consecutive marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game Features

- **Grid Size**: A larger 5x5 grid allows for more complex strategies compared to traditional tic-tac-toe.

- **Unique Restrictions**: Each player has three randomly generated spaces where they cannot play, introducing variability each time the game is reset.

- **Winning Conditions**: Players win by forming four consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonally.

## Modes of Play

- **Single Player Mode**: Compete against an AI powered by the minimax algorithm, which calculates optimal moves.

- **Double Player Mode**: Play against another human.





## Technology Implemented

1. **Tkinter**  
   Tkinter is Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library, used for building the game window and managing player interactions. It allows for easy button creation and responsive event handling.

2. **Minimax Algorithm**  
   The minimax algorithm, enhanced with alpha-beta pruning, optimizes the AI's decision-making by evaluating possible moves and predicting outcomes. An evaluation function assesses the board state, considering potential wins and threats.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- Players alternate turns, with the game checking for valid moves based on restrictions.
- The game continuously evaluates the state after each turn to detect wins or draws.
- A reset option allows players to start fresh, re-randomizing restricted spaces.
